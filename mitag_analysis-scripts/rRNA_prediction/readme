How to run meta-RNA program:

Go into directory of "XXX/rRNA_prediction/examples/e1". Then modify the content of "run.sh" file:

export PATH=/home/swu/rRNA_prediction/rRNA_hmm_fs_wst_v0:$PATH
../../scripts/rRNA_hmm_run_wst_v0.pl  input.1 output.1


First line: give the path for HMM3.0 software. You should change it to your local path like "XXXXXXX/rRNA_prediction/rRNA_hmm_fs_wst_v0:$PATH".
Second line: run rRNA prediction with two parameters:
(1) "input.1" is a directory containing all the DNA FASTA files. In this examples, only one file "a.fna" is used.
(2) "output.1" is a directory containing the output files: a.fna.coord, a.fna.seq, a.fna..mask

To run the program, you should first create "input.1" directory and put all your DNA FASTA files into it. You don't need to create "output.1" directory before running the program.
